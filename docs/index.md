# Setup Tutorial
1. Download the file and install it on your server (duh)
2. If you would like to change either the colour of the dimension, whether or not the dimension is shown, or in future other config options, edit the config.yml to your liking (all colour codes can be found [here](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php))
3. Done :)
